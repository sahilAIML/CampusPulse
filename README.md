## 🌟 Executive Overview
> 🌐 **Live Production Deployment**: [**https://campuspulse.bytexl.live/**](https://campuspulse.bytexl.live/)

**CampusPulse** transforms fragmented campus data (biometric RFID turnstiles, continuous internal evaluation marks, LMS engagement logs, coding profiles, and CDC placement assessments) into **actionable, explainable decision intelligence**. 

Unlike retrospective dashboards that report failures after semester finals, CampusPulse operates as a **leading-indicator early-warning platform**, empowering faculty mentors to intervene weeks ahead, forecasting machine-learning placement risk, and providing students with algorithmic, high-ROI improvement roadmaps.
